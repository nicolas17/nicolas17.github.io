Description: Transparent application fuzzer
 Zzuf is a transparent fuzzer. It works by intercepting applications' file and
 network operations and changing random bits in their input. Its behaviour is
 deterministic, making it easy to reproduce bugs.
 .
 Zzuf has support for variable fuzzing ratio, character filtering, fuzzing
 decision based on filenames and optional network fuzzing. It can also stop
 processes that run for too long or that output too much data.
 .
 This iOS package is built for both armv7 and arm64. It fails to fuzz certain
 executables (I haven't found why); but this is not a problem with tools like
 fuzzycactus which just use zzuf to filter files.
